# Frontend-bootcamp-landing-page
This is a clone of a frontend web development bootcamp that was made with instructions from the youtube channel Travesry media, it is a static site made with only html and css
the majority of the design was done using bootstrap making this my first bootstrap based project, most of the text is place holder text, so far i dont have any issue with the site
it was done as an learning exercise and i may commit changes to it any time i feel it necessary in the future.
